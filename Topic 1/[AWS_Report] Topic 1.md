###### :+1: What is cloud computing?
Here's a more official definition from the National Institute of Standards and Technology:

>............
*Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.*

###### :+1: Clouds are often divided into the following types:
- `Public`: A cloud managed by an organization and open to use by the general public.
- `Private`: A cloud that virtualizes and shares the IT infrastructure within a single
organization.
- `Hybird`: A mixture of a public and a private cloud.

###### :+1: Cloud computing services also have several classifications:
- `Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)`: Offers fundamental resources like computing,
storage, and networking capabilities, using virtual servers such as Amazon EC2,
Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure virtual machines.
- `Platform as a service (PaaS)`: Provides platforms to deploy custom applications to
the cloud, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Heroku.
- `Software as a service (SaaS)`: Combines infrastructure and software running in
the cloud, including office applications like Amazon WorkSpaces, Google Apps
for Work, and Microsoft Office 365

###### :tada: Note:
> - AWS is a public cloud
> - The AWS product portfolio contains IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Let’s take a more concrete look at what you can do with AWS.
